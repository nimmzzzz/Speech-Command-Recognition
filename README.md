# Speech-Command-Recognition
Speech command recognition system using Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and MFCC features

# Speech Command Recognition using HMM 🗣️

## 📌 Overview
A simple speech recognition system that detects predefined voice commands using Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and MFCC feature extraction. The model predicts sequences based on trained audio command data.

## 📌 Features
- MFCC feature extraction from audio signals  
- Bigram language modeling for command prediction  
- HMM-based sequence prediction and decoding  
- Supports basic command recognition

## 📌 Tech Stack
- Python
- SpeechRecognition
- pyaudio
    
## 📌 Status
Completed as part of academic coursework in speech processing.
